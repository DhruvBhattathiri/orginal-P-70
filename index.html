        <p>The campus is the tangible manifestation of the philosophy of integral education, constructed so as to gain the blessings of nature. With 150-year-old trees that sprawl and create an oasis in the middle of the busy metro, with a heritage building on campus, with vibrations that put the mind at ease, education ‘happens’ here.

The school has a creative mix of open learning spaces and closed class rooms and other facilities. Sprinkled across the campus are creative spaces that are unique to the environment of the school. You may spot a ‘machaan’ (a wooden platform on a tree) where two-three students are absorbed in a discussion, or a teacher telling a story to a small group of students in a grove, the loner would be sitting on a rock lost in the world of a novel, while the budding poet admires the newly sprung green leaves next to the door of the classroom, a rope ladder may invite you to leave the sand pit and seek new heights…

Students have the opportunity of a life time, as they can get a chance to study under the trees where they can shake hands with the branches. Here nature is not seen as an intrusion, but a teacher that awakens the deep secrets of the soul. That too in the heart of busy Bangalore!

        <p>Holistic
Integral education aims to address the physical, emotional and mental aspects of the individual and help a child to understand her/himself from within. It focuses on developing key faculties (abilities and talents) so that a child grows up with not just information and training, but becomes a total individual who goes into a life long journey of evolution and growth. The focus and emphasis shifts in this type of education from information acquisition to self development in its essence.

Friendly atmosphere
The emotional development of students is made possible because of the non-threatening and friendly atmosphere, wherein a child learns to cultivate self-discipline while being sensitive to the needs of others. A joyous involvement of the child in an atmosphere of freedom and support, brings out the best in him. There is an encouragement on the progress of the child at his or her own pace, without constant comparison or competition. A sense of introspection and self-reflection is inculcated, that helps the child to understand values at a deeper level. Further the serene environment help the child to become calm and centered. The child grows with trees, flowers, friends and fun. This creates a space of joy and ease in the heart of the child leading to true emotional development.

Powers of the mind
Integral education focuses on development of the faculties and development of qualities which form the back-bone of all meaningful learning. Language, music, arts, crafts, dance, theatre, scientific exploration, games and sports are a part of the curriculum. The ‘learning by rote’ method is replaced by interesting activities and absorbing projects that greatly stimulate the interest of the child and evoke deeper response from him.

Individual importance
An individualised approach is adopted for children in order to bring out their full potential. Children may have some elements or exercises tailored specifically for their unique talents and needs. It could take the form of extra challenges, special creative exercises, extra or different classes and programmes suited to needs and talents of the individual child. This naturally implies a small number of students in a group to facilitate individual attention (20 per group).</p>

<div class="col-lg-9 col-md-9 col-sm-9 col-xs-12 movie_text" > <h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalize"> </h5> <p>Our school celebrated Holi on 9th Feb. It was a gathering of both the pre- primary and primary in unison. The program started with a song that explained the excitement and enthusiasm of the festival. The essence of Holi was explained with a short story of Hiranyankashyap, who is believed to be a devil king. Thus focusing on the central idea of the festival, that is the victory of good over evil. In addition, how is Holi celebrated in different regions of India? Gave the program an insightful value. An enthusiastic group of diyas sang an originally composed Holi song and the whole school joined them by clapping to its beats. The wisdom courtyard saw a beautiful celebration as everyone wished each other with flowers. This gave this festival a deep meaning of love, friendship and togetherness.</p> </div> </div>

<div class="col-lg-9 col-md-9 col-sm-9 col-xs-12 movie_text" > <h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalize"></h5> <p>Our school celebrated its pre-primary “Talent Exhibit”on 7th February. This gave us the platform to show-case the exuberant talent that our little ones possess. Every corner of the classroom sparked a creative display of the plethora of work done by our tiny-tots, followed by presentations where they cutely summed up their detailed activities. The look on the faces of every parent spoke aloud about how proud they were, looking at the efforts of their children and the diyas in-charge.
Our students were involved in the “Compost Project”. This compost was made by the students of grade 7th. Our school upholds the value of being in-sync with the eco-system and so this project was a special one, where the students created the compost using a variety of ingredients. Also the importance of compost and its benefits, was explained to the parents in the form of a detailed presentation. The icing on the cake was, that you could also buy the product from the students. This left the students thrilled as they saw many sellers.</p> </div> </div>
